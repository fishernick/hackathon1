Boilerplate is an all in one website for accessing Purdue resources with near-infinite scalability and access to the Brightspace api using the Purdue login page and the session cookies saved by logging in. It supports cross-session validation and proxied api requests through the backend gateway supported by the NodeJS server either locally run or through a network.

Boilerplate's features currently include a map for displaying local crime recorded by West Lafayette campus' crime catalog, a tool using a trained dataset interpreter that displays the best dining location on the West Lafayette campus for your preferred food categories, a ChatGPT wrapper that is pre-prompted to answer Purdue-relevant questions, and a schedule for all due Brightspace items.
